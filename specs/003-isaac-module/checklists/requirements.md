# Specification Quality Checklist: Isaac Module Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [Isaac Module Documentation](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Review Notes**:
- Specification follows same successful pattern as Module 02 (Digital Twin)
- 4 user stories (P1-P4) with clear priorities and independent test criteria
- 15 functional requirements covering all 4 chapters plus Docusaurus integration
- 8 measurable success criteria focused on learner outcomes
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear
- In Scope / Out of Scope sections provide clear boundaries
- Dependencies properly reference Module 01 and Module 02 as prerequisites
- Edge cases identified with mitigation strategies
- Content is conceptual (no implementation details like "use this API" or "install this package")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and learner-focused

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ Yes - Proceed with `/sp.plan`

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed from user
- Pattern proven successful in Module 02 implementation
- All 4 chapters clearly scoped with educational focus
