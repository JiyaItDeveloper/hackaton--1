# Module 3: Build & Deployment Systems

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of our robotics development journey! In this module, we'll focus on building, packaging, and deploying the digital twin simulation system that we developed in Module 2. This module covers the essential practices for creating production-ready robotics applications, from containerization to deployment pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Containerize robotics applications using Docker
- Create ROS 2 packages and build systems
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for robotics projects
- Deploy simulation environments to cloud platforms
- Package Unity applications with ROS 2 integration
- Optimize performance for production deployment
- Monitor and maintain deployed systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (Digital Twin)
- Understanding of Docker and containerization concepts
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD pipelines
- Familiarity with cloud deployment platforms
- Experience with build systems and packaging

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Containerization & Docker** - Packaging robotics applications with Docker
2. **Chapter 2: ROS 2 Build Systems** - Creating and managing ROS 2 packages
3. **Chapter 3: CI/CD Pipelines** - Implementing continuous integration and deployment
4. **Chapter 4: Cloud Deployment & Monitoring** - Deploying to cloud platforms with monitoring
5. **Integration Project: Complete Deployment Pipeline** - Building a full deployment system

## Why Build & Deployment Matters

In robotics development, proper build and deployment practices are crucial because:

- **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent behavior across development, testing, and production
- **Scalability**: Allows for easy scaling of simulation and deployment environments
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updates, patches, and version management
- **Reliability**: Reduces deployment errors and system downtime
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work with consistent environments

Let's begin our journey into building and deploying robotics systems!
