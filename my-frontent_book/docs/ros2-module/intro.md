# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Module Overview

Welcome to **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - your comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing ROS 2 as the foundational middleware for humanoid control and AI integration.

### Module Goal
This module will teach you ROS 2 as the nervous system of a humanoid robot, enabling communication between Python AI agents and robot controllers.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Understand the purpose and architecture of ROS 2 in Physical AI systems
2. Implement ROS 2 communication patterns (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions)
3. Create Python AI agents that interface with ROS 2 controllers
4. Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
5. Design message flows between AI logic and robot controllers

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

### Module Structure
This module is organized into 4 comprehensive chapters:

- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Fundamentals - Introduction to ROS 2 concepts and architecture
- **Chapter 2**: ROS 2 Communication Model - Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- **Chapter 3**: Python AI Agents with ROS 2 - Integration of AI algorithms with ROS 2
- **Chapter 4**: Humanoid Modeling with URDF - Robot modeling and visualization

Let's begin your journey into the world of ROS 2!
