# ROS 2 Module: Section 001

## Introduction to ROS 2

Welcome to the ROS 2 module! This section serves as your initial introduction to the Robot Operating System 2, which acts as the nervous system for humanoid robots and AI systems.

### What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
- Learn how to set up and configure ROS 2 environments
- Explore communication patterns in ROS 2
- Build AI agents that interact with ROS 2 controllers
- Model humanoid robots using URDF

### Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

### ROS 2 Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides libraries, tools, and conventions that simplify the development of complex robot behavior across various platforms.

Key features of ROS 2 include:
- Distributed computing capabilities
- Real-time system support
- Enhanced security features
- Improved architecture for multi-robot systems

## Getting Started

To begin working with ROS 2, you'll need to:
1. Install the appropriate ROS 2 distribution
2. Set up your development environment
3. Create your first ROS 2 workspace
4. Understand the basic communication patterns

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll be ready to dive deeper into the fundamentals of ROS 2 in the following chapters.
