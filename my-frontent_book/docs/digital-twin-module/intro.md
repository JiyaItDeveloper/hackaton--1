# Module 02: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 02 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This module introduces you to **digital twins** — virtual replicas of physical robots that enable safe, cost-effective testing and development.

## Module Overview

In this module, you'll learn how to create digital twins of humanoid robots using simulation environments. By the end, you'll understand how to leverage simulation for safe testing before deploying to real hardware.

## What You'll Learn

This module is organized into four comprehensive chapters:

1. **[Chapter 1: Digital Twins in Physical AI](./chapter-1/fundamentals.md)**
   Understand the purpose and benefits of digital twins, simulation-first robotics, and compare Gazebo vs Unity platforms.

2. **[Chapter 2: Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./chapter-2/gazebo-physics.md)**
   Learn physics engine fundamentals, how to load humanoid URDF models, and validate robot motion in simulation.

3. **[Chapter 3: Interaction & Visualization with Unity](./chapter-3/unity-visualization.md)**
   Explore Unity's visual realism capabilities, human-robot interaction scenarios, and synchronizing robot state between systems.

4. **[Chapter 4: Simulated Sensors](./chapter-4/simulated-sensors.md)**
   Master sensor simulation including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs, with realistic noise modeling for AI development.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- ✅ Completed Module 01 (ROS 2 fundamentals and humanoid modeling)
- ✅ Basic understanding of ROS 2 communication (nodes, topics, messages)
- ✅ Familiarity with URDF robot modeling
- ✅ Basic knowledge of 3D coordinate systems

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the benefits of digital twins in robotics development
- Compare simulation platforms (Gazebo vs Unity) and select appropriate tools
- Understand physics simulation principles for humanoid robots
- Describe how to synchronize simulation with visualization systems
- Configure simulated sensors for AI/ML training and testing
- Apply simulation-first development practices to reduce hardware costs and risks

## Module Philosophy: Simulation-First

This module emphasizes **simulation-first robotics** — the practice of developing, testing, and validating robot behaviors in virtual environments before deploying to physical hardware. This approach:

- 🛡️ **Reduces risk** of damaging expensive hardware during development
- ⚡ **Accelerates iteration** by enabling rapid testing without hardware setup
- 💰 **Lowers costs** by minimizing physical prototyping requirements
- 🧪 **Enables comprehensive testing** in scenarios difficult or dangerous to replicate physically

## Ready to Begin?

Start with [Chapter 1: Digital Twins in Physical AI](./chapter-1/fundamentals.md) to build your foundation in simulation-based robotics development.
