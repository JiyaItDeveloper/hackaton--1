# Prompt Text

```
now you have to implement all module 3 content with module 1 and 2  without any error
```

# Response Text

Successfully implemented integration content connecting Module 3 (Isaac - The AI-Robot Brain) with Modules 1 (ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System) and 2 (Digital Twin - Simulation with Gazebo & Unity). Added explicit connection points throughout the Isaac module documentation, corrected prerequisite references, and enhanced all chapters with content showing how Isaac builds upon the ROS 2 foundation and digital twin concepts.

# Outcome & Impact

Created comprehensive integration between three robotics modules, ensuring students understand how Isaac builds on the ROS 2 communication foundation and enhances digital twin simulation concepts. All modules now form a cohesive learning path with clear connections between concepts.
