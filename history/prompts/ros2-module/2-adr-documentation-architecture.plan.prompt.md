# Prompt History Record: ADR Documentation Architecture

## PROMPT_TEXT

documentation-architecture

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created ADR-1: Documentation Architecture for ROS 2 Module. The ADR documents the decision to use Docusaurus v3 as the documentation framework with Markdown content, chapter-based organization, and hierarchical navigation. The decision was made to create comprehensive educational content for ROS 2 in humanoid robotics that is maintainable, accessible, and follows best practices. The ADR includes consequences (positive and negative), alternatives considered, and references to related documents.

## OUTCOME

Successfully created the first Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the ROS 2 module project, documenting the documentation architecture decision. The ADR follows the template format and captures the important decision about using Docusaurus for the educational content.
