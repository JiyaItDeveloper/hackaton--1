# Prompt History Record: ROS 2 Module Specification

## Original Prompt
User requested to create a plan for a Docusaurus project with modules/chapters structure for a ROS 2 module.

## Context
The ROS 2 module is part of a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The specification document outlines a comprehensive 4-chapter module covering ROS 2 fundamentals, communication patterns, Python AI integration, and humanoid modeling with URDF.

## Specification Overview
The module is structured as follows:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Understanding ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid control
- Architecture and design goals
- Comparison with ROS 1

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Model
- Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- Quality of Service settings
- Communication patterns for humanoid control

### Chapter 3: Python AI Agents with ROS 2
- rclpy integration
- AI algorithm integration with ROS 2
- Real-time performance considerations

### Chapter 4: Humanoid Modeling with URDF
- Robot description format
- Links, joints, and coordinate frames
- Visualization in RViz

## Outcome
Successfully created and documented the ROS 2 module specification with clear learning objectives, module structure, technical requirements, and assessment methods. The specification serves as a foundation for developing educational content focused on ROS 2 in the context of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
